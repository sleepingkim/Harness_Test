# Cross Document Linker — Legal Document Cross-Reference & Consistency Management

Manages reference relationships and consistency across Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy, Refund Policy, and Copyright Notice.

## Cross-Reference Matrix Between Documents

### Shared Definition Framework

|-------------|----------------|-----------------------|-----------------|
| "Service" | Terms of Service Article 2 | All documents | Use identical definition |
| "Member/User" | Terms of Service Article 2 | All documents | Unify identical terminology |
| "Personal Information" | Privacy Policy Article 1 | Terms, Cookie Policy | Apply Privacy Policy definition |
| "Cookie" | Cookie Policy Article 1 | Privacy Policy | Apply Cookie Policy definition |
| "Paid Service" | Terms of Service Article X | Refund Policy | Same scope |
| "Content" | Terms of Service Article X | Copyright Notice | Identical definition |

### Verification Summary
| Rule ID | Rule | Status | Documents |
|---------|------|--------|-----------|
| CR-01 | Service name match | ✅ | All |
| CR-03 | Collection items match | ❌ | Terms ↔ Privacy Policy |

### Inconsistency Details (🔴)
1. **CR-03**: Terms of Service specifies collection of "phone number"; missing from Privacy Policy
   - Fix: Add "phone number" to Privacy Policy collection items

### Improvement Recommendations (🟡)
1. **CR-08**: Terms of Service uses "member"; Refund Policy uses "user"
   - Fix: Unify to "member"
```

## Version Control Rules

```
Document version synchronization:
  - When any one document is changed, related documents must be reviewed
  - Set identical effective dates
  - Record cross-impact documents in the change history table
  - Keep previous versions accessible for at least 30 days
```
