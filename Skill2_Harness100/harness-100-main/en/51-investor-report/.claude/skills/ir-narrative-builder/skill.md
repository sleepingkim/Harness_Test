# IR Narrative Builder — Investor Communication Narrative Construction Tool

A specialized skill that enhances the investor narrative capabilities of strategy-updater and ir-reviewer agents.

## Target Agents

- **strategy-updater** — Equity Story construction, strategy narrative writing
- **ir-reviewer** — Narrative consistency verification, investor-type-specific tone review

## Equity Story 5-Stage Framework

```
1. WHY NOW — Why this market right now (market opportunity)
2. WHY US — Why us (competitive advantage)
3. PROOF POINTS — Is there evidence (performance data)
4. WHERE NEXT — What is the next step (growth strategy)
5. WHY INVEST — Why should you invest (value creation)
```

### Stage-by-Stage Writing Guide

| Stage | Core Question | Elements to Include | Cautions |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|----------|
| WHY NOW | Market inflection point | TAM/SAM/SOM, regulatory changes | Guard against overestimation |
| WHY US | Differentiation basis | Technology moat, network effects | Avoid abstract expressions |
| PROOF POINTS | Quantitative results | Revenue, customers, NPS | Guard against cherry-picking |
| WHERE NEXT | Execution roadmap | Product, market expansion | Feasibility |
| WHY INVEST | Valuation | Multiples, comparable companies | Conservative estimates |

## Narrative Tone by Investor Type

### For VCs
**Tone**: Vision-centered, emphasize growth potential
**Structure**: Executive Summary → Market Opportunity → Product Milestones → Growth Metrics → Team → Runway → Next Targets

### For PE
**Tone**: Numbers-centered, emphasize operational efficiency
**Structure**: Executive Summary → P&L/CF/BS → EBITDA Bridge → KPI Benchmarks → Value Creation Plan → Risks → Initiatives

### For Public Shareholders
**Tone**: Balanced, emphasize transparency
**Structure**: CEO Letter → Financial Highlights → Business Unit Performance → Market Environment → ESG → Shareholder Returns → Outlook

## EBITDA Bridge Construction

```
Prior Quarter EBITDA
  (+) Revenue increase effect
  (+) Margin improvement effect
  (-) Labor cost increase
  (-) Marketing cost increase
  (+/-) FX effect
  (+/-) One-time items
= Current Quarter EBITDA
```

**Principles:** List in order of magnitude, positive before negative, distinguish one-time vs. structural

## Narrative Quality Checklist (for ir-reviewer)

### Consistency Verification
- [ ] Do figures exactly match the financial analysis?
- [ ] Is the narrative direction consistent with the prior quarter report?
- [ ] Is the balance between positive/negative information appropriate?
- [ ] Do forward-looking statements have disclaimers?

### Persuasiveness Verification
- [ ] Do all claims have data-backed evidence?
- [ ] Are risks honestly disclosed?
- [ ] Do next quarter targets meet SMART criteria?

## Risk Disclosure 3-Level Matrix

| Grade | Criteria | Expression Approach |
|-------|---------|---------------------|
| HIGH | High probability and high impact risk | Specific response plan required |
| MEDIUM | Monitoring needed | Specify early warning indicators |
| LOW | Controllable | Brief mention |

**Principle:** Do not hide risks → build investor trust. Present risk + response plan as a pair.
