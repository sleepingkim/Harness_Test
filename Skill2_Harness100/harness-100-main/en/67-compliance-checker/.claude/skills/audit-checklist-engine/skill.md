# Audit Checklist Engine — Compliance Audit Checklist Generation Engine

Converts regulatory obligations into practical inspection items and quantitatively assesses compliance levels.

## Audit Framework: 5-Level Maturity Model

### Compliance Maturity Levels

| Level | Name | Description | Score |
|-------|------|-------------|-------|
| L1 | Unaware | Unaware that the obligation exists | 0 |
| L2 | Aware/Non-Compliant | Aware but no action taken | 25 |
| L3 | Partially Compliant | Some actions completed, deficiencies exist | 50 |
| L4 | Fully Compliant | Minimum legal requirements met | 75 |
| L5 | Best Practice | Industry-leading level of operation | 100 |

### Overall Compliance Rate Calculation

```
compliance_rate(%) = sum(item_maturity_score x weight) / sum(weight x 100) x 100

weight calculation:
  - Criminal punishment related: 5.0
  - Business suspension related: 4.0
  - High fines (100M+): 3.0
  - General fines: 2.0
  - Administrative guidance: 1.0

grades:
  A (90%+): Excellent — maintain
  B (70-89%): Good — improvement items exist
  C (50-69%): Insufficient — systematic improvement needed
  D (30-49%): Poor — urgent improvement needed
  F (under 30%): Critical — immediate correction required
```

## Audit Report Output Structure

```markdown
## Compliance Audit Report

**Target**: [Organization Name] | **Audit Domain**: [Domain] | **Audit Date**: [Date]
**Overall Compliance Rate**: [XX]% | **Grade**: [A/B/C/D/F]

### Results Summary by Domain
| Domain | Inspection Items | Compliant | Non-Compliant | Compliance Rate |
|--------|-----------------|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| Personal Data | 20 | 15 | 5 | 75% |

### Immediate Correction Required (Red)
1. [Item] — Current Status: [L?], Risk: [Violation sanctions]

### Improvement Recommended (Yellow)
1. [Item] — Current Status: [L?], Recommendation: [Action content]

### Best Practices (Green)
1. [Item] — L5 achieved
```

## Improvement Priority Calculation Formula

```
priority_score = risk_impact(1-25) x (1 - current_compliance_rate) x cost_efficiency(1-5)

cost_efficiency:
  5: No cost/immediately possible (document preparation, training)
  4: Low cost/short-term (within 1 month)
  3: Medium cost/mid-term (within 3 months)
  2: High cost/long-term (6+ months)
  1: Major investment/system implementation

order: highest score first = quickly, at low cost, eliminating major risk
```
