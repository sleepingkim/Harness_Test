# Operations Manual — Automated Operations Manual Generation Pipeline

Analyzes existing documents, code, and wikis to produce process flowcharts, step-by-step manuals, FAQs, and training materials through agent team collaboration.

## Execution Mode

**Agent Team** — 5 members communicate directly via SendMessage and cross-validate each other's work.

## Agent Roster

| Agent | File | Role | Type |
|-------|------|------|------|
| document-analyst | `.claude/agents/document-analyst.md` | Existing document/code analysis, process extraction | general-purpose |
| flowchart-designer | `.claude/agents/flowchart-designer.md` | Mermaid flowcharts, RACI matrix | general-purpose |
| manual-writer | `.claude/agents/manual-writer.md` | Step-by-step procedures, checklists | general-purpose |
| faq-builder | `.claude/agents/faq-builder.md` | FAQ, troubleshooting, escalation | general-purpose |
| training-producer | `.claude/agents/training-producer.md` | Quizzes, hands-on exercises, summary cards | general-purpose |

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Preparation (performed directly by the orchestrator)

1. Extract from user input:
    - **Target processes**: Scope of work/systems to document
    - **Source materials**: Existing document paths, code repositories, wiki URLs
    - **Target audience**: New hires/experienced staff/managers — manual users
    - **Constraints** (optional): Specific format requirements, existing manual templates
2. Create the `_workspace/` directory in the project root
3. Organize the input and save to `_workspace/00_input.md`
4. If an existing manual is provided, copy to `_workspace/` and switch to update mode
5. Determine the **execution mode** based on the request scope (see "Execution Modes by Scope" below)

### Phase 2: Team Assembly and Execution

Assemble the team and assign tasks. Task dependencies:

| Order | Task | Owner | Dependencies | Deliverable |
|-------|------|-------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | Document/code analysis | analyst | None | `_workspace/01_document_analysis.md` |
| 2 | Process flowcharts | designer | Task 1 | `_workspace/02_process_flowcharts.md` |
| 3a | Step-by-step manual | writer | Tasks 1, 2 | `_workspace/03_step_by_step_manual.md` |
| 3b | FAQ/troubleshooting | faq | Tasks 1, 2 | `_workspace/04_faq_troubleshooting.md` |
| 4 | Training materials | producer | Tasks 3a, 3b | `_workspace/05_training_materials.md` |

Tasks 3a (manual) and 3b (FAQ) run **in parallel**. Both depend only on Tasks 1 and 2, so they can start simultaneously.

**Inter-team communication flow:**
- analyst completes → sends process inventory/branching conditions to designer, raw procedure data/glossary to writer, gap analysis/tacit knowledge to faq
- designer completes → sends flowcharts/RACI to writer, exception flows to faq, Level 0 map to producer
- writer/faq complete → sends manual structure and key FAQ items to producer
- producer generates training materials from all deliverables and performs final consistency validation between manual and training materials

### Phase 3: Integration and Final Deliverables

The orchestrator performs final integration validation:

1. Verify all files in `_workspace/`
2. Cross-validation checklist:
    - [ ] All flowchart processes are described as procedures in the manual
    - [ ] All manual exception situations are reflected in the FAQ
    - [ ] All glossary terms are used consistently in the manual
    - [ ] Quiz content in training materials matches the manual
3. Request corrections from the relevant agent if discrepancies are found (up to 2 rounds)
4. Save validation results to `_workspace/06_review_report.md`
5. Report the final summary to the user

## Execution Modes by Scope

| User Request Pattern | Execution Mode | Agents Involved |
|---------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| "Create a complete operations manual" | **Full Pipeline** | All 5 |
| "Analyze this code's processes" | **Analysis Mode** | analyst + designer |
| "Add FAQ to this procedure doc" (existing file) | **FAQ Mode** | faq + producer |
| "Update the existing manual" | **Update Mode** | analyst (changes only) + writer + faq |
| "Just create training materials" (existing manual) | **Training Mode** | producer solo |

**Leveraging existing files**: When the user provides existing manuals, procedures, or flowcharts, copy those files to the appropriate location in `_workspace/` and skip the corresponding agent's phase.

## Data Transfer Protocol

| Strategy | Method | Usage |
|----------|--------|-------|
| File-based | `_workspace/` directory | Primary deliverable storage and sharing |
| Message-based | SendMessage | Real-time key information transfer, correction requests |
| Task-based | TaskCreate/TaskUpdate | Progress tracking, dependency management |

File naming convention: `{order}_{agent}_{deliverable}.{ext}`

## Error Handling

| Error Type | Strategy |
|-----------|----------|
| Source file inaccessible | analyst works with accessible sources only, lists "unanalyzed sources" in report |
| Process extraction impossible | Present interview questions for key processes to user, work from answers |
| Document contradictions | Prioritize code-based behavior, record contradictions in gap analysis |
| Mermaid rendering limitations | Split complex diagrams into sub-processes, supplement with text descriptions |
| Agent failure | 1 retry → proceed without that deliverable if still failing, note omission in review report |

## Test Scenarios

### Normal Flow
**Prompt**: "Create a deployment process manual for our team. Sources include deploy.sh, CI config files, and existing wiki docs."
**Expected Results**:
- Analysis report: 3 sources analyzed, process inventory, glossary
- Flowcharts: Deployment process Levels 0-1, including rollback exception flows
- Manual: Pre/during/post deployment step-by-step procedures, checklists
- FAQ: Deployment failure troubleshooting, rollback decision tree
- Training materials: Deployment hands-on exercise for new developers

### Existing File Flow
**Prompt**: "Based on this procedure doc, just add FAQ and training materials" + existing manual file
**Expected Results**:
- Existing manual copied to `_workspace/03_step_by_step_manual.md`
- FAQ mode: faq extracts exception situations from the manual to create FAQs
- producer generates training materials based on the manual

### Error Flow
**Prompt**: "Create a customer service process manual, there are no docs, I'll explain verbally"
**Expected Results**:
- analyst extracts processes from user description (interview mode)
- Report specifies "Based on verbal description — field verification required"
- All deliverables include "[Verification needed]" tags
