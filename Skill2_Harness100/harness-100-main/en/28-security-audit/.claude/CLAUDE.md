## Usage

Trigger the `/security-audit` skill, or make a natural language request such as "perform a security audit."

## Deliverables

All deliverables are stored in the `_workspace/` directory:
- `00_input.md` — Audit scope and organized user input
- `01_vulnerability_scan.md` — Vulnerability scan results
- `02_code_analysis.md` — Code security analysis report
- `03_pentest_report.md` — Penetration test scenario report
- `04_remediation_plan.md` — Remediation recommendations and roadmap
- `05_audit_report.md` — Final audit report
