# Technical Writer — technical document writing pipeline

structuredesign→→diagram→review→versionmanagement An agent team collaborates to generate all deliverables at once.

## execution mode

**agent team** — 5 agents communicate directly via SendMessage and cross-verify each other's work.

## agent composition

| agent | file | role | type |
|---------|------|------|------|
| info-architect | `.claude/agents/info-architect.md` | structure design, reader analysis, table of contents | general-purpose |
| doc-writer | `.claude/agents/doc-writer.md` | body text writing, code example, | general-purpose |
| diagram-maker | `.claude/agents/diagram-maker.md` | Mermaid diagram, wheneach material | general-purpose |
| tech-reviewer | `.claude/agents/tech-reviewer.md` | accuracy, completeness, consistency verify | general-purpose |
| version-controller | `.claude/agents/version-controller.md` | data, change capability, deployment | general-purpose |

## workflow

### Phase 1: preparation (Orchestrator directly perform)

1. Extract from user input:
 - **document week**: regarding documentperson
 - **document type** (optional): API//guide//operations
 - **target reader** (optional): role, technical level
 - **reference material** (optional): code, existing document, 
 - **existing file** (optional): existing document plan, structureplan
2. `_workspace/` Create the directory at the project root
3. Organize input and save to `_workspace/00_input.md`
4. If existing files are provided, copy them to `_workspace/`and skip the corresponding Phase
5. Determine the **execution mode** based on the scope of the request

### Phase 2: team composition and execution

| order | task | responsible | dependency | deliverable |
|------|------|------|------|--------|
| 1 | structure design | architect | None | `_workspace/01_doc_structure.md` |
| 2a | body text | writer | task 1 | `_workspace/02_doc_draft.md` |
| 2b | diagram writing | diagram | task 1 | `_workspace/03_diagrams.md` |
| 3 | technical review | reviewer | task 2a, 2b | `_workspace/04_review_report.md` |
| 4 | version management | version | task 1~3 | `_workspace/05_version_meta.md` |

task 2a(body text) and 2b(diagram) ** execution**. task 1(structure) only dependency when whenworkto do number .

**teamKRW between flow:**
- architect complete → writerto table of contents·content strategy, diagramto diagram requirement, versionto data deliver
- writer ↔ diagram: position, caption 
- reviewer body text+diagram cross-verification. 🔴 required revision findings when Request revision from the relevant agent -> rework -> re-verify (up to 2 rounds)
- version review result reflectedto final data 

### Phase 3: integration and final deliverable

1. `_workspace/` Verify all files in the directory
2. review reportConfirm that all critical revisions from the review report have been addressed
3. Report the final summary to the user:
 - document structure — `01_doc_structure.md`
 - document body text — `02_doc_draft.md`
 - diagram — `03_diagrams.md`
 - review report — `04_review_report.md`
 - version — `05_version_meta.md`

## task scaleby mode

| user request pattern | execution mode | deploy agent |
|----------------|----------|-------------|
| "technical document overall writing" | **Full pipeline** | 5people beforeKRW |
| "document structure only " | **design mode** | architect + reviewer |
| " contentas document " (structure ) | ** mode** | writer + diagram + reviewer |
| " document diagram addition" | **diagram mode** | diagram + reviewer |
| " document reviewplease do" | **review mode** | reviewer |
| " document please do" (existing version) | ** mode** | writer + reviewer + version |

**existing file utilization**: existing document, code, provide applicable stage case existing material basedas task.

## data deliver protocol

| strategy | method | also |
|------|------|------|
| File-based | `_workspace/` | Store and share major deliverables |
| Message-based | SendMessage | Real-time key information transfer, revision requests |
| Task-based | TaskCreate/TaskUpdate | Progress tracking, dependency management |

File naming convention: `{}_{agent}_{deliverable}.{extensionspecialist}`

## error handling

| error type | strategy |
|----------|------|
| document week/scope people | reader·purpose afterreport present, optional also |
| technical taxdepartmentmatters insufficient | [confirm needed] , review when verify |
| code example verify impossible | "verify needed" tablewhen, readerto test |
| agent failure | Retry once -> proceed without that deliverable, note the gap in the review report |
| reviewfrom 🔴 findings | Request revision from the relevant agent -> rework -> re-verify (up to 2 rounds) |

## test scenario

### flow
**Prompt**: " team API documentplease do. target external developmentspecialist, REST API 5items endpoint ."
**expected result**:
- structure: API reference type, external developmentspecialist target reader analysis, endpointby section design
- body text: authentication, endpoint 5items detailed, error code, example code
- diagram: authentication when, process flowchart
- review: technical accuracy·completeness verify
- version: v1.0.0, Published status

### existing file utilization flow
**Prompt**: " document structure existing, body text writingplease do" + structure file department
**expected result**:
- mode: writer + diagram + reviewer deploy
- architect case, existing structure based task

### error flow
**Prompt**: "technical document , week versus whensystem before"
**expected result**:
- scope versus → architect document minute proposal ( overview, API, operations guide etc.)
- reader people → withindepartment developmentspecialist/external developmentspecialist/operationsteam afterreport present
- priority documentdepartment task
