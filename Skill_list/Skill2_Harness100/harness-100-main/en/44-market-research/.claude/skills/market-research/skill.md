# Market Research — Full Market Research Pipeline

An agent team collaborates to generate industry analysis, competitive analysis, consumer research, trend analysis, and integrated reports.

## Execution Mode

**Agent Team** — Five agents communicate directly via SendMessage and perform cross-validation.

## Agent Composition

| Agent | File | Role | Type |
|-------|------|------|------|
| industry-analyst | `.claude/agents/industry-analyst.md` | Market size, value chain, industry structure | general-purpose |
| competitor-analyst | `.claude/agents/competitor-analyst.md` | Competitor mapping, SWOT, positioning | general-purpose |
| consumer-analyst | `.claude/agents/consumer-analyst.md` | Segmentation, personas, needs analysis | general-purpose |
| trend-analyst | `.claude/agents/trend-analyst.md` | PESTLE, technology trends, scenarios | general-purpose |
| research-reviewer | `.claude/agents/research-reviewer.md` | Cross-validation, insight synthesis, strategic recommendations | general-purpose |

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Preparation (performed directly by the orchestrator)

1. Extract the following from user input:
    - **Research objective**: What business decision will this inform?
    - **Industry/Market**: Target industry, geography, market segment
    - **Existing data** (optional): Prior research, internal data
    - **Deliverable focus**: Full research or specific analysis area
2. Create `_workspace/` directory and save input to `_workspace/00_input.md`
3. Determine execution mode based on request scope

### Phase 2: Team Assembly and Execution

| Order | Task | Owner | Dependencies | Deliverable |
|-------|------|-------|-------------|-------------|
| 1a | Industry analysis | industry-analyst | None | `_workspace/01_industry_analysis.md` |
| 1b | Competitor analysis | competitor-analyst | None | `_workspace/02_competitor_analysis.md` |
| 2a | Consumer analysis | consumer-analyst | Tasks 1a, 1b | `_workspace/03_consumer_analysis.md` |
| 2b | Trend analysis | trend-analyst | Tasks 1a, 1b | `_workspace/04_trend_analysis.md` |
| 3 | Research review | research-reviewer | Tasks 2a, 2b | `_workspace/05_research_report.md` |

Tasks 1a and 1b run in parallel. Tasks 2a and 2b run in parallel.

### Phase 3: Integration and Final Deliverables

1. Verify all files, confirm CRITICAL findings addressed
2. Report final summary to user

## Execution Modes by Request Scope

| User Request Pattern | Execution Mode | Agents Deployed |
|---------------------|---------------|----------------|
| "Full market research" | **Full pipeline** | All 5 agents |
| "Just industry analysis" | **Industry mode** | industry-analyst + reviewer |
| "Competitive analysis only" | **Competition mode** | competitor-analyst + reviewer |
| "Consumer research" | **Consumer mode** | consumer-analyst + reviewer |
| "Trend analysis" | **Trend mode** | trend-analyst + reviewer |

## Error Handling

| Error Type | Strategy |
|-----------|----------|
| Industry not specified | Request clarification or propose 3 related industries |
| Insufficient data | Use analogous markets, clearly note assumptions |
| Agent failure | Retry once > proceed without that deliverable |
