# Social Media Manager — SNS Content Full Production Pipeline

An agent team collaborates to generate SNS content strategy, posts, visuals, and hashtags all at once.

## Execution Mode

**Agent Team** — 5 members communicate directly via SendMessage and cross-validate each other's work.

## Agent Composition

| Agent | File | Role | Type |
|-------|------|------|------|
| sns-strategist | `.claude/agents/sns-strategist.md` | Channel analysis, content calendar, campaign design | general-purpose |
| copywriter | `.claude/agents/copywriter.md` | Post copy, captions, CTAs | general-purpose |
| visual-planner | `.claude/agents/visual-planner.md` | Image concepts, card news, Reels planning | general-purpose |
| hashtag-analyst | `.claude/agents/hashtag-analyst.md` | Hashtag strategy, trend analysis | general-purpose |
| performance-reviewer | `.claude/agents/performance-reviewer.md` | KPI alignment, quality verification | general-purpose |

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Preparation (Performed Directly by the Orchestrator)

1. Extract from user input:
   - **Brand/Account Info**: Industry, tone & voice, target customers
   - **Platforms**: Instagram, Twitter/X, TikTok, Facebook, LinkedIn
   - **Period**: Weekly/monthly content plan
   - **Goals** (optional): Brand awareness, conversion, community growth
   - **Existing Files** (optional): Brand guide, existing content
2. Create the `_workspace/` directory in the project root
3. Organize the input and save it to `_workspace/00_input.md`
4. If existing files are present, copy them to `_workspace/` and skip the corresponding Phase
5. **Determine the execution mode** based on the scope of the request

### Phase 2: Team Assembly and Execution

| Order | Task | Assigned To | Dependencies | Deliverable |
|-------|------|------------|--------------|-------------|
| 1 | SNS strategy | sns-strategist | None | `_workspace/01_strategy.md` |
| 2a | Post copy | copywriter | Task 1 | `_workspace/02_posts.md` |
| 2b | Hashtag strategy | hashtag-analyst | Task 1 | `_workspace/04_hashtags.md` |
| 3 | Visual planning | visual-planner | Tasks 1, 2a | `_workspace/03_visuals.md` |
| 4 | Performance review | performance-reviewer | Tasks 2a, 2b, 3 | `_workspace/05_review_report.md` |

Tasks 2a (copy) and 2b (hashtags) are **executed in parallel**. Visual planning (3) starts after copy is complete.

**Inter-team communication flow:**
- sns-strategist complete -> Deliver tone and calendar to copywriter, keywords and competitor accounts to hashtag-analyst, brand guide to visual-planner
- copywriter complete -> Deliver text overlays and image keywords to visual-planner, post topics to hashtag-analyst
- hashtag-analyst complete -> Deliver trend hashtags to visual-planner
- performance-reviewer cross-validates all deliverables. When RED Must Fix is found, request revisions from the relevant agent -> rework -> re-verify (up to 2 times)

### Phase 3: Integration and Final Deliverables

1. Verify all files in `_workspace/`
2. Confirm that all RED Must Fix items from the review report have been addressed
3. Report the final summary to the user:
   - Strategy/Calendar — `01_strategy.md`
   - Post Copy — `02_posts.md`
   - Visual Plan — `03_visuals.md`
   - Hashtag Strategy — `04_hashtags.md`
   - Review Report — `05_review_report.md`

## Modes by Task Scale

| User Request Pattern | Execution Mode | Agents Deployed |
|---------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| "Create SNS content," "Full management" | **Full Pipeline** | All 5 |
| "Just create a content calendar" | **Strategy Mode** | strategist + reviewer |
| "Just write Instagram posts" | **Copy Mode** | copywriter + hashtag-analyst + reviewer |
| "Just analyze hashtags" | **Hashtag Mode** | hashtag-analyst + reviewer |
| "Review this post" | **Review Mode** | reviewer only |

**Using Existing Files**: When the user provides brand guides, content calendars, etc., copy the files to the appropriate location in `_workspace/` and skip the corresponding agents.

## Data Transfer Protocol

| Strategy | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| File-Based | `_workspace/` directory | Storing and sharing major deliverables |
| Message-Based | SendMessage | Real-time delivery of key information, revision requests |
| Task-Based | TaskCreate/TaskUpdate | Progress tracking, dependency management |

File naming convention: `{sequence}_{deliverable_name}.{extension}`

## Error Handling

| Error Type | Strategy |
|-----------|----------|
| Brand info insufficient | Apply industry-standard guide, note "customization needed" |
| Web search failure | Work with general SNS knowledge, note "trend data limited" |
| Agent failure | 1 retry -> if still fails, proceed without that deliverable, note omission in review report |
| RED found in review | Request revision from relevant agent -> rework -> re-verify (up to 2 times) |
| Image generation failure | Proceed with text concepts and prompts only, available for user retry |

## Test Scenarios

### Normal Flow
**Prompt**: "Plan monthly Instagram content for a health food brand. Target is women in their 20s-30s, tone is friendly and bright."
**Expected Result**:
- Strategy: Monthly calendar (3-4x/week), content pillar mix, KPI settings
- Posts: 12-16 Instagram captions (feed + Reels + carousel mix)
- Visuals: Image concepts per post, carousel layouts, Reels storyboards
- Hashtags: Hashtag sets per post (pyramid strategy applied)
- Review: Full consistency matrix verified

### Existing File Utilization Flow
**Prompt**: "Write 3 Instagram posts this week using this brand guide" + guide file attached
**Expected Result**:
- Copy brand guide to `_workspace/`
- Copy Mode: Deploy copywriter + hashtag-analyst + reviewer
- Skip strategist, visual-planner (or minimal involvement)

### Error Flow
**Prompt**: "Just analyze SNS hashtags, topic is cafe entrepreneurship"
**Expected Result**:
- Switch to Hashtag Mode (hashtag-analyst + reviewer)
- Brand info insufficient, so generate hashtag library based on "cafe entrepreneurship" industry
- Review report notes "Strategy/Posts/Visuals not generated"
