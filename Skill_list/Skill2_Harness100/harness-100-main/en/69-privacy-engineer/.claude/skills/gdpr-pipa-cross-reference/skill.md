description: "Cross-reference database for GDPR and Korea's Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA). The 'privacy-law-analyst' and 'consent-designer' agents must use this skill's article mappings and gap analysis when analyzing multi-jurisdiction privacy requirements and designing consent forms. Use for 'GDPR vs PIPA comparison', 'legal requirements cross-analysis', 'global compliance strategies', etc. Note: data flow mapping and technical safeguard design are outside the scope of this skill."

Article-level mapping, gap analysis, and unified compliance guide for EU GDPR and Korea's Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA).

## Core Principles Cross-Mapping

| Principle | GDPR (Article) | PIPA (Article) | Differences |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|-------------|
| Lawfulness | Art.6 (6 legal bases) | Art.15 (Consent principle) | GDPR provides more legal bases |
| Purpose Limitation | Art.5(1)(b) | Art.3 No.1 | Similar |
| Data Minimization | Art.5(1)(c) | Art.3 No.1, Art.16 | Similar |
| Accuracy | Art.5(1)(d) | Art.3 No.3 | Similar |
| Storage Limitation | Art.5(1)(e) | Art.21 | Similar |
| Security | Art.5(1)(f), Art.32 | Art.29 | GDPR more detailed |
| Accountability | Art.5(2) | Art.3 No.8 | GDPR more emphasized |

## Consent Requirements Comparison

### GDPR's 4 Requirements for Valid Consent

```
1. Freely given
   - No detriment for refusal
   - Bundling unnecessary consent with service provision is prohibited

2. Specific
   - Separate consent per processing purpose
   - Blanket consent not permitted

3. Informed
   - Prior notice of controller identity, purpose, and rights
   - Clear and plain language

4. Unambiguous indication
   - Affirmative action required (no pre-checked boxes)
   - Implied consent not recognized
```

### PIPA Consent Requirements

1. Notice and Consent (Art.15, Art.17)
   - Notify of collection/use purpose, items, and retention period
   - Mandatory and optional items must be separated

2. Cases requiring separate consent
   - Sensitive information (Art.23)
   - Unique identification information (Art.24)
   - Marketing purposes (Art.22)
   - Third-party provision (Art.17)
   - Cross-border transfer (Art.28-8)

3. Consent methods

| Child consent | Under 16: parental consent | Under 14: legal guardian consent | Age 14 threshold (stricter) |
| Proof of consent | Controller must demonstrate | Processor must demonstrate | Retain consent logs |
