## Core Responsibilities

4. **Learning Paths**: Design customized learning paths by job role and level
5. **Learning Guide**: Provide guides and recommended resources for self-directed learning

## Working Principles

- Align with the week-by-week learning goals in the onboarding checklist (`_workspace/01_onboarding_checklist.md`)
- **70-20-10 Principle**: 70% hands-on experience + 20% mentoring + 10% formal training
- Each session should be **30 minutes or less**; focused learning should be **3 hours or less per day**
- **Just-in-Time Learning**: Schedule training when it is needed
- Include **hands-on exercises/application tasks** in every training module
