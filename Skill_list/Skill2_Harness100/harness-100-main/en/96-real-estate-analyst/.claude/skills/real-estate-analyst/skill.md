# Real Estate Analyst — Real Estate Investment Analysis Pipeline

An agent team collaborates to produce market research, location analysis, profitability analysis, risk assessment, and investment reports.

## Execution Mode

**Agent Team** — 5 members communicate directly via SendMessage and cross-validate each other's work.

## Agent Roster

| Agent | File | Role | Type |
|-------|------|------|------|
| market-researcher | `.claude/agents/market-researcher.md` | Macroeconomics, regional markets, price trends | general-purpose |
| location-analyst | `.claude/agents/location-analyst.md` | Transit, school districts, commercial areas, development catalysts | general-purpose |
| profitability-analyst | `.claude/agents/profitability-analyst.md` | Rental yield, IRR, cash flow | general-purpose |
| risk-assessor | `.claude/agents/risk-assessor.md` | Regulatory, market, liquidity risks | general-purpose |
| report-writer | `.claude/agents/report-writer.md` | Comprehensive investment report, investment opinion | general-purpose |

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Preparation (Performed Directly by Orchestrator)

1. Extract from user input:
    - **Analysis Target**: Specific property (address, listing) or area/type
    - **Investment Objective**: Owner-occupancy / rental income / capital gains / mixed
    - **Budget**: Equity, financing plan
    - **Investment Horizon**: Short-term (1-2 years) / Medium-term (3-5 years) / Long-term (5+ years)
    - **Constraints** (optional): Specific requirements (school district, transit, area, etc.)
2. Create the `_workspace/` directory at the project root
3. Organize the input and save it as `_workspace/00_input.md`
4. **Determine the execution mode** based on the scope of the request

### Phase 2: Team Assembly and Execution

| Order | Task | Owner | Dependencies | Deliverable |
|-------|------|-------|-------------|-------------|
| 1a | Market Research | researcher | None | `_workspace/01_market_research.md` |
| 1b | Location Analysis | location | None | `_workspace/02_location_analysis.md` |
| 2 | Profitability Analysis | profitability | Tasks 1a, 1b | `_workspace/03_profitability_analysis.md` |
| 3 | Risk Assessment | risk | Tasks 1a, 1b, 2 | `_workspace/04_risk_assessment.md` |
| 4 | Investment Report | writer | Tasks 1a, 1b, 2, 3 | `_workspace/05_investment_report.md` |

Tasks 1a (Market Research) and 1b (Location Analysis) run **in parallel**.

**Inter-Agent Communication Flow:**
- researcher + location complete in parallel -> deliver price, interest rate, and location data to profitability
- researcher -> deliver policy and market risk data to risk
- location -> deliver development catalyst uncertainties and environmental risks to risk
- profitability completes -> deliver leverage and cash flow risk data to risk
- risk completes -> deliver overall risk rating and stress test results to writer
- writer synthesizes all results into the investment report

### Phase 3: Integration and Final Deliverables

1. Verify all files in `_workspace/`
2. Cross-validation:
    - [ ] Do the market research price data and the profitability analysis purchase price match?
    - [ ] Is the location score accurately reflected in the report?
    - [ ] Do the risk assessment scenarios align with the profitability analysis scenarios?
    - [ ] Is the investment opinion supported by the analysis results?
3. If discrepancies are found, request corrections from the relevant agent (up to 2 times)
4. Present the final summary to the user

## Execution Modes by Request Scope

| User Request Pattern | Execution Mode | Agents Deployed |
|---------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| "Run a full real estate investment analysis" | **Full Pipeline** | All 5 agents |
| "Just do market research for this area" | **Market Mode** | researcher only |
| "Just analyze this apartment's location" | **Location Mode** | location only |
| "Just calculate the yield" | **Yield Mode** | profitability only |
| "Just assess the investment risks" | **Risk Mode** | researcher + risk |
| "Compare these two properties" | **Comparison Mode** | All 5 agents x 2 properties compared |

## Data Transfer Protocol

| Strategy | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| File-Based | `_workspace/` directory | Store and share main deliverables |
| Message-Based | SendMessage | Real-time key information delivery, correction requests |
| Task-Based | TaskCreate/TaskUpdate | Progress tracking, dependency management |

## Error Handling

| Error Type | Strategy |
|-----------|----------|
| Market data retrieval failure | Work with most recent available data, note the reference date |
| Insufficient property details | Analyze using regional averages, request property specifics from user |
| Tax/legal judgment required | Note "Professional consultation recommended", estimate using standard criteria |
| Unable to form investment opinion | Issue "Hold (additional data needed)" opinion, list required data |
| Agent failure | Retry once -> if still fails, proceed without that deliverable, note in report |

## Test Scenarios

### Normal Flow
**Prompt**: "I'm considering investing in an apartment in Mapo-gu, Ahyeon-dong, Seoul. My budget is $300K equity and $400K in loans. I plan to hold for 3-5 years for both rental income and capital gains."
**Expected Results**:
- Market Research: Mapo-gu sale/lease trends, supply outlook, interest rate environment
- Location Analysis: Ahyeon New Town transit (Line 2, Gyeongui-Jungang Line), school districts, commercial areas, development catalysts
- Profitability: Cap Rate, IRR, optimistic/neutral/pessimistic scenarios, leverage effect
- Risk: Interest rate increase risk, oversupply risk, stress tests
- Report: Executive Summary, investment opinion (Buy/Hold/Avoid), checklist

### Comparative Analysis Flow
**Prompt**: "Which is better, a studio in Gangnam or an apartment in Mapo?"
**Expected Results**:
- Full pipeline analysis for each property
- Comparison table: location score, yield, risk rating side-by-side
- Recommendation by investment objective: Property A for rental income, Property B for capital gains

### Error Flow
**Prompt**: "Is real estate investment a good idea?"
**Expected Results**:
- No specific property/area provided, so only macro market analysis is performed
- Prompt user for specifics: area, budget, objectives
- Provide a general real estate investment checklist
