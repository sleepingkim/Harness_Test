# Security Audit — security audit  pipeline

security auditof vulnerability→codeanalysis→penetrationtestreport→improvement inthisbefore teamthis to  in count.

## execution 

**inthisbefore team** — 5peoplethis SendMessageas direct and  verification.

## inthisbefore setup

| inthisbefore | day | role | type |
|---------|------|------|------|
| vulnerability-scanner | `.claude/agents/vulnerability-scanner.md` | CVE, dependency, configurationerror  | general-purpose |
| code-analyst | `.claude/agents/code-analyst.md` | SAST, queue, patterndetection | general-purpose |
| pentest-reporter | `.claude/agents/pentest-reporter.md` | attack, PoC, impactanalysis | general-purpose |
| security-consultant | `.claude/agents/security-consultant.md` | improvement, asmap, frameworkmapping | general-purpose |
| audit-reviewer | `.claude/agents/audit-reviewer.md` | verification, risketc., finalreport | general-purpose |

## workflow

### Phase 1:  (this direct count)

1. user from :
    - **audit upper**: code , infrastructure, this URL
    - **audit scope**: before/minutes, included/excluded item
    - ** stack**: language, framework, , DB
    - ** requiredmatter** (optional): GDPR, itemsinformation, before
    - **existing report** (optional): thisbefore audit report, vulnerability 
2. `_workspace/`  project rootin creation
3.  to `_workspace/00_input.md`in 
4. audit upper code  analysis scope 
5. existing daythis  `_workspace/`in and corresponding Phase cases
6. request scopein  **execution  decision**

### Phase 2: team setup and execution

team setupand  .  between of  and :

|  |  | responsible | of |  |
|------|------|------|------|--------|
| 1a | vulnerability  | scanner |  | `_workspace/01_vulnerability_scan.md` |
| 1b | code security analysis | analyst |  | `_workspace/02_code_analysis.md` |
| 2 | penetration test report | pentest |  1a, 1b | `_workspace/03_pentest_report.md` |
| 3 | improvement  | consultant |  1a, 1b, 2 | `_workspace/04_remediation_plan.md` |
| 4 | audit review | reviewer |  1a, 1b, 2, 3 | `_workspace/05_audit_report.md` |

 1a()and 1b(codeanalysis) **parallel execution**.   initial ofthis as in startto count .

**team between  :**
- scanner completed → analystto CWE mapping before, pentestto attack possible vulnerability before
- analyst completed → pentestto data ·attack  before
- pentest completed → consultantto business impact·urgentalso before
- consultant completed → reviewerto before improvement plan before
- reviewer all   verification. 🔴 required modification   corresponding inthisbeforeto modification request →  → verification (maximum 2)

### Phase 3: integrated and final 

reviewerof report as final  :

1. `_workspace/` within all day confirmation
2. review reportof 🔴 required modificationthis   confirmation
3. final  userto report:
    - vulnerability  — `01_vulnerability_scan.md`
    - code analysis — `02_code_analysis.md`
    - penetration test — `03_pentest_report.md`
    - improvement  — `04_remediation_plan.md`
    - final audit report — `05_audit_report.md`

##  per 

| user request pattern | execution  |  inthisbefore |
|----------------|----------|-------------|
| "security audit before count" | ** audit** | 5people before |
| "this code security analysis" | **code analysis ** | analyst + reviewer |
| "vulnerability " | ** ** | scanner + reviewer |
| "security improvement  only" (existing report) | **consulting ** | consultant + reviewer |
| "this security report " | **review ** | reviewer  |

## test 

### normal 
****: "this Node.js Express  codethisin about before security audit count"
** result**:
- : npm dependency CVE ,  detection, configuration 
- codeanalysis: OWASP Top 10 criteria vulnerability(XSS, SQL Injection, CSRF etc.), modification code included
- penetrationtest: 3~5items attack , MITRE ATT&CK mapping, PoC procedure
- improvement: NIST CSF  analysis, ·· asmap
- review:   beforeitem confirmation

### existing day for 
****: "thisbefore audit report as improvement in progress upper and addition " + thisbefore report 
** result**:
- thisbefore report `_workspace/`in 
- consulting : consultant + reviewer 
- thisbefore vulnerability resolution  tracking +  

### error
