description: "A full pipeline where an agent team collaborates to handle everything from nutritional analysis to cooking guides for meal management. Use this skill for any meal, nutrition, or recipe-related requests such as 'create a meal plan', 'weekly meal plan', 'diet meal plan', 'bulking meal plan', 'diabetic meal plan', 'baby food plan', 'grocery list', 'analyze my nutrition', 'give me a recipe', 'meal prep plan', 'calorie count', 'manage my diet'. If an existing meal plan is provided, supports nutritional analysis and improvement.

# Meal Planner — Full Meal Management Pipeline

An agent team collaborates to generate nutrition analysis → meal design → recipes → grocery list → cooking guide all at once.

## Execution Modes

**Agent Team** — 4 agents communicate directly via SendMessage and cross-validate each other.

## Agent Composition

| Agent | File | Role | Type |
|---------|------|------|------|
| nutritionist | `.claude/agents/nutritionist.md` | Nutritional analysis, calorie & macro goal setting | general-purpose |
| meal-designer | `.claude/agents/meal-designer.md` | Daily/weekly meal plan design | general-purpose |
| recipe-writer | `.claude/agents/recipe-writer.md` | Detailed recipes, nutritional info, ingredient substitutions | general-purpose |
| shopping-coordinator | `.claude/agents/shopping-coordinator.md` | Grocery list, cooking guide, meal prep | general-purpose |

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Preparation (Orchestrator performs directly)

1. Extract from user input:
    - **Physical info**: gender, age, height, weight, activity level
    - **Goal**: weight loss / maintenance / weight gain / muscle gain / health management
    - **Dietary restrictions** (optional): allergies, vegetarian, religious restrictions, medical conditions
    - **Preferences** (optional): liked/disliked foods, cooking time constraints
    - **Duration**: how many days/weeks of meal plan
    - **Number of people**: single / family size
2. Create a `_workspace/` directory in the project root
3. Organize the input and save to `_workspace/00_input.md`
4. **Determine execution mode** based on the scope of the request

### Phase 2: Team Assembly and Execution

| Order | Task | Assigned To | Depends On | Output |
|------|------|------|------|--------|
| 1 | Nutritional analysis & goal setting | nutritionist | None | `_workspace/01_nutrition_analysis.md` |
| 2 | Meal plan design | meal-designer | Task 1 | `_workspace/02_meal_plan.md` |
| 3 | Recipe writing | recipe-writer | Tasks 1, 2 | `_workspace/03_recipes.md` |
| 4a | Grocery list | shopping-coordinator | Task 3 | `_workspace/04_shopping_list.md` |
| 4b | Cooking guide | shopping-coordinator | Tasks 2, 3 | `_workspace/05_cooking_guide.md` |

**Team communication flow:**
- nutritionist completes → sends calorie & macro targets and dietary restrictions to meal-designer
- meal-designer completes → requests recipe writing per menu item from recipe-writer, sends meal prep strategy to shopping-coordinator
- recipe-writer completes → sends full ingredient list to shopping-coordinator
- shopping-coordinator verifies consistency when consolidating ingredients. If gaps or mismatches found, requests confirmation from recipe-writer

### Phase 3: Integration and Final Deliverables

1. Review all files in `_workspace/`
2. Verify that nutrient totals in the meal plan and recipes match the targets
3. Report final summary to the user:
    - Nutritional analysis — `01_nutrition_analysis.md`
    - Meal plan — `02_meal_plan.md`
    - Recipe collection — `03_recipes.md`
    - Grocery list — `04_shopping_list.md`
    - Cooking guide — `05_cooking_guide.md`

## Mode by Task Scope

| User Request Pattern | Execution Mode | Agents Deployed |
|----------------|----------|-------------|
| "Create a full meal plan", "weekly meal plan" | **Full Pipeline** | All 4 agents |
| "Calculate my calories" | **Nutrition Analysis Mode** | nutritionist only |
| "Give me a recipe for tonight's dinner" | **Recipe Mode** | recipe-writer only |
| "Analyze the nutrition of this meal plan" (existing file) | **Analysis Mode** | nutritionist only |
| "Just make me a grocery list" (meal plan provided) | **Shopping Mode** | shopping-coordinator only |

**Using existing files**: If the user provides an existing meal plan, copy it to `_workspace/02_meal_plan.md` and skip that step.

## Data Transfer Protocol

| Strategy | Method | Purpose |
|------|------|------|
| File-based | `_workspace/` directory | Store and share primary deliverables |
| Message-based | SendMessage | Real-time key info delivery, revision requests |
| Task-based | TaskCreate/TaskUpdate | Progress tracking, dependency management |

File naming convention: `{order}_{agent}_{deliverable}.{extension}`

## Error Handling

| Error Type | Strategy |
|----------|------|
| Insufficient physical info from user | Use default values based on population averages, mark as "estimated" |
| Extreme calorie targets | Adjust to safe range + display warning |
| Dietary restrictions make menu composition difficult | Suggest alternative menus + nutrition supplementation guidance |
| Agent failure | 1 retry → if still failing, proceed without that deliverable and note the gap in the report |
| Nutrient targets not met | Request menu replacement from meal-designer (max 2 times) |

## Test Scenarios

### Normal Flow
**Prompt**: "Male in his 30s, 178cm, 82kg, office worker who exercises 3 times a week. Create a 1-week meal plan to lose 5kg."
**Expected Results**:
- Nutritional analysis: BMR → TDEE calculation, deficit calories (~1800kcal), macro distribution
- Meal plan: 7 days × 3 meals + snacks, daily calorie target achievement rate 95% or above
- Recipes: minimum 15 recipes (excluding duplicates), with ingredient substitutions
- Grocery list: consolidated list by category, split into 2 shopping trips per week, budget estimate
- Cooking guide: Sunday meal prep plan + daily cooking timeline

### Existing File Flow
**Prompt**: "Here's my current meal plan — analyze the nutrition and tell me how to improve it" + attached meal plan file
**Expected Results**:
- Copy existing meal plan to `_workspace/02_meal_plan.md`
- nutritionist performs nutritional analysis of the current meal plan
- Generate report including improvement recommendations

### Error Flow
**Prompt**: "I have a nut allergy and can't eat dairy. Create a vegan meal plan."
**Expected Results**:
- Apply dietary restrictions: exclude all nuts, dairy, and animal products
- Inform of protein deficiency risk + strengthen plant-based protein sources in the meal plan
- Recommend supplementation for vitamin B12, calcium, and omega-3
- Provide thorough list of ingredient substitutions

## Per-Agent Extended Skills

| Agent | Extended Skill | Purpose |
|---------|----------|------|
| nutritionist, meal-designer | `nutrition-calculator` | BMR/TDEE calculation, macro distribution formulas |
| recipe-writer, meal-designer | `ingredient-substitution-engine` | Allergy substitutions, dietary restriction handling |
```
ner | `ingredient-substitution-engine` | Allergy substitutes, dietary restriction handling |
```
