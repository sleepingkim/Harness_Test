# Unfair Terms Detector — Detection & Revision Tool

Automatically detects unfair clauses based on the Act on the Regulation of Terms and Conditions (Terms Act) and suggests fair alternatives.

## Classification of Unfair Terms Types (Terms Act Standards)

### Liability Exemption Clauses (Article 7)

| Violation Type | Description | Unfair Example | Fair Revision |
|----------|------|-----------|-----------|
| Exemption for intent/negligence | Exemption from operator's own liability | "We are not responsible for damages caused by our negligence" | "We will compensate for damages caused by our intentional misconduct or negligence in accordance with applicable laws" |
| Data loss exemption | Loss of user data | "We are not responsible for data loss due to service interruption" | "In the event of data loss caused by our fault, we will make recovery efforts and provide compensation" |
| Service quality exemption | Full exemption from service defects | "The service is provided as-is" | "We maintain a reasonable level of service quality and will remedy any significant defects" |

### Termination & Cancellation (Article 9)

| Violation Type | Unfair Example | Fair Revision |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Unilateral termination | "We may delete your account without prior notice" | "In the event of a terms violation, we will restrict service if not remedied within 14 days after a prior warning" |
| Disadvantage upon termination | "Fees already paid will not be refunded upon termination" | "Upon termination, fees for the remaining period will be prorated and refunded" |
| Difficult termination process | "Termination is only available by calling customer support" | "Termination can be done directly from online account settings" |

### Damages (Articles 7 & 8)

| Violation Type | Unfair Example | Fair Revision |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Excessive penalty | "Early termination incurs a penalty of 100% of remaining period fees" | "Early termination incurs a penalty of 10% of remaining period fees" |
| Imbalanced compensation | "User shall compensate for all damages in the event of a terms violation" (coexisting with operator exemption) | "Both parties are subject to the same standard of liability for damages" |

### Implied Consent (Article 10)

| Violation Type | Unfair Example | Fair Revision |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Implied consent | "Failure to object within 30 days will be deemed consent to the terms change" | "Separate consent will be sought for material changes; if consent is refused, the previous terms will be maintained or the contract may be terminated" |

## Automatic Detection Keyword Patterns

### High-Risk Keywords (Immediate Review Required)

```
- "shall bear no responsibility whatsoever"
- "under any circumstances"
- "without prior notice"
- "non-refundable"
- "as-is"
- "may not raise any objection"
- "deemed to have consented"
- "may change at discretion"
- "at our sole discretion"
```

### Medium-Risk Keywords (Review Recommended)

```
- "unavoidable reasons"
- "within reasonable scope" (criteria unclear)
- "customary" (undefined)
- "when necessary" (requirements unclear)
- "in accordance with applicable laws" (no specific provisions cited)
```

## Review Scoring

```
Unfairness Score = Σ(severity of violation per clause) / total number of clauses

Severity:
  5: Definite Terms Act violation (subject to FTC corrective order)
  4: High likelihood of violation
  3: Potential for violation
  2: Improvement recommended
  1: Best practice

Grade:
  A (1.0–1.5): Fair terms
  B (1.6–2.5): Good (minor improvements needed)
  C (2.6–3.5): Insufficient (improvement needed)
  D (3.6–4.5): Poor (urgent improvement required)
  F (4.6–5.0): Dangerous (legal risk)
```
