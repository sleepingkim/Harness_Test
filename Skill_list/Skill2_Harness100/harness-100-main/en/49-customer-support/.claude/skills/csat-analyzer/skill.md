# CSAT Analyzer — Customer Satisfaction Metric Design + Analysis

A skill that enhances the CS performance measurement capabilities of cs-analyst.

## Target Agents

- **cs-analyst** — Designs and analyzes CS metric systems
- **cs-reviewer** — Validates CS quality based on metrics

## 3 Core CS Metrics

### CSAT (Customer Satisfaction Score)

```
Question: "How satisfied were you with this interaction?" (1-5 scale)

CSAT = (4 + 5 rated responses) / Total responses x 100%

Benchmarks:
  Excellent: 85%+
  Good: 70-84%
  Needs Improvement: 60-69%
  At Risk: <60%

Measurement Timing: Immediately after interaction (interaction-based)
```

### NPS (Net Promoter Score)

```
Question: "How likely are you to recommend this service to a friend or colleague?" (0-10 scale)

Classification:
  Promoter: 9-10
  Passive: 7-8
  Detractor: 0-6

NPS = Promoter% - Detractor%  (Range: -100 to +100)

Benchmarks (B2C SaaS):
  Excellent: 50+
  Good: 30-49
  Average: 0-29
  At Risk: <0

Measurement Timing: Quarterly (relationship-based)
```

### CES (Customer Effort Score)

```
Question: "How easy was it to resolve your issue?" (1-7 scale)

CES = Average of all responses

Benchmarks:
  Excellent: 5.5+
  Good: 4.5-5.4
  Needs Improvement: 3.5-4.4
  At Risk: <3.5

Measurement Timing: Immediately after interaction (effort-based)
Note: Strongest predictor of repeat purchase behavior
```

## Operational Metrics

### Efficiency Metrics

| Metric | Formula | Benchmark |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| FCR (First Contact Resolution) | 1st contact resolutions / Total cases x 100 | 70-75% |
| AHT (Average Handle Time) | Total handle time / Number of cases | Chat 5-8 min, Phone 6-10 min |
| ASA (Average Speed of Answer) | Total wait time / Answered cases | Chat 30 sec, Phone 60 sec |
| Escalation Rate | Escalated cases / Total cases | <15% |
| Re-inquiry Rate | Re-inquiries within 7 days / Total cases | <20% |

### Productivity Metrics

| Metric | Formula | Purpose |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Cases per Agent | Daily cases / Number of agents | Capacity planning |
| Cost per Channel | Channel cost / Channel cases | Channel optimization |
| Self-Service Ratio | FAQ/bot resolutions / Total inquiries | Automation effectiveness |

## VOC (Voice of Customer) Analysis Framework

### Sentiment Classification

```
Positive Keywords: thank you, fast, friendly, resolved, satisfied, great
Negative Keywords: complaint, slow, inconvenient, repeated, no response, angry
Neutral: inquiry, confirmation, curious, please let me know

Sentiment Score = (Positive count - Negative count) / Total count
```

### Topic Classification

```
1. Category-based Classification:
   - Product Feature Issues (40%)
   - Billing/Refunds (25%)
   - Shipping/Logistics (15%)
   - Account/Authentication (10%)
   - Other (10%)

2. Trend Analysis:
   - Surging topic detection (week-over-week +50%)
   - New topic identification
   - Seasonal patterns

3. Severity Classification:
   - Critical: Service outage, financial loss
   - Major: Feature malfunction, recurring issues
   - Minor: Inconvenience, improvement requests
```

## CS Dashboard Design

```
Real-Time Monitor (Operations Team):
+------------+------------+------------+
| Queue Count| Avg Wait   | Agents     |
| [Real-time]| [Real-time]| [Avail/Total]|
+------------+------------+------------+
| Hourly Incoming Volume Graph          |
+---------------------------------------+
| Channel Status (Chat/Phone/Email)     |
+---------------------------------------+

Weekly/Monthly Report (Management):
+------------+------------+------------+
| CSAT       | NPS        | FCR        |
| [Trend]    | [Trend]    | [Trend]    |
+------------+------------+------------+
| Inquiry Distribution by Topic + WoW   |
+---------------------------------------+
| Agent Performance (Volume, CSAT)      |
+---------------------------------------+
| Top 5 VOC Issues                      |
+---------------------------------------+
```

## Improvement Framework

```
When CSAT is low:
  1. Agent training (response quality)
  2. Improve response templates
  3. Authority delegation (immediate resolution capability)

When FCR is low:
  1. Strengthen FAQ/knowledge base
  2. Expand agent authority
  3. Redefine escalation criteria

When AHT is high:
  1. Provide macros/templates
  2. Improve internal tool UX
  3. Training + mentoring
```
