# Risk Register — project risk managementversus Full pipeline

project risk identification→assessment→response→monitoring→reporting An agent team collaborates to generate all deliverables at once.

## execution mode

**agent team** — 5 agents communicate directly via SendMessage and cross-verify each other's work.

## agent composition

| agent | file | role | type |
|---------|------|------|------|
| risk-identifier | `.claude/agents/risk-identifier.md` | risk identification, RBS | general-purpose |
| assessment-analyst | `.claude/agents/assessment-analyst.md` | probability·impact assessment, matrix | general-purpose |
| response-strategist | `.claude/agents/response-strategist.md` | response strategy, cost- and | general-purpose |
| monitoring-planner | `.claude/agents/monitoring-planner.md` | KRI, , monitoring | general-purpose |
| report-writer | `.claude/agents/report-writer.md` | dashboard, integration report | general-purpose |

## workflow

### Phase 1: preparation (Orchestrator directly perform)

1. Extract from user input:
 - **project overview**: people, goal, scale, duration
 - **project type**: IT/case/R&D//service etc.
 - **stakeholder**: core stakeholder and expectedmatters
 - **constraint condition** (optional): budget, schedule, technical, 
 - **existing material** (optional): existing risk list, 
2. `_workspace/` Create the directory at the project root
3. Organize input and save to `_workspace/00_input.md`
4. existing material `_workspace/` companyand applicable Phase 
5. Determine the **execution mode** based on the scope of the request

### Phase 2: team composition and execution

| order | task | responsible | dependency | deliverable |
|------|------|------|------|--------|
| 1 | risk identification | identifier | None | `_workspace/01_risk_identification.md` |
| 2 | probability·impact assessment | analyst | task 1 | `_workspace/02_risk_assessment.md` |
| 3 | response strategy establish | strategist | task 1, 2 | `_workspace/03_response_strategy.md` |
| 4 | monitoring plan | planner | task 2, 3 | `_workspace/04_monitoring_plan.md` |
| 5 | status report | writer | task 1, 2, 3, 4 | `_workspace/05_status_report.md` |

**teamKRW between flow:**
- identifier complete → analystto risk list·RBS, strategistto ·dependencynature deliver
- analyst complete → strategistto priority·EMV, plannerto score standard deliver
- strategist complete → plannerto ·natureindicator, writerto response summary deliver
- planner complete → writerto monitoring schedule·KRI deliver
- writer all deliverable cross-verification, dayvalue findings when applicable agent revision request (versus 2)

### Phase 3: integration and final deliverable

1. `_workspace/` Verify all files in the directory
2. writer consistency verify result reflected
3. Report the final summary to the user

## task scaleby mode

| user request pattern | execution mode | deploy agent |
|----------------|----------|-------------|
| "risk managementversus overall create it" | **Full pipeline** | 5people beforeKRW |
| "risk identification only please do" | **identification mode** | identifier |
| " risk list assessmentplease do" (existing list) | **assessment mode** | analyst + strategist + writer |
| "risk response strategy only establishplease do" | **response mode** | strategist + writer |
| "risk status report create it" (existing etc.recorddepartment) | **reporting mode** | writer |

## data deliver protocol

| strategy | method | also |
|------|------|------|
| File-based | `_workspace/` | Store and share major deliverables |
| Message-based | SendMessage | Real-time key information transfer, revision requests |
| Task-based | TaskCreate/TaskUpdate | Progress tracking, dependency management |

File naming convention: `{}_{agent}_{deliverable}.{extensionspecialist}`

## error handling

| error type | strategy |
|----------|------|
| project information insufficient | identifier by day risk template provide, "[ needed]" specify |
| data None | analyst nature assessment versus, "[data secure after re-assessment]" tablebasis |
| web search failure | day degree based risk derive, report "reference limitation" specify |
| agent failure | Retry once -> proceed without that deliverable, report specify |
| consistency dayvalue | writer revision request → re-task (versus 2) |

## test scenario

### flow
**Prompt**: "6months companywithin ERP whensystem project risk managementversus create it. budget 1000M, teamKRW 15people."
**expected result**:
- identification: RBS 6items category, risk 20~30case, annual risk 
- assessment: 5×5 matrix, EMV , Critical 3~5case
- response: Critical avoidance/mitigation, cost- and analysis, residual risk
- monitoring: KRI 10items+, weekbetween/monthbetween review, condition
- report: management 1degree, , Top 5 risk

### existing material utilization flow
**Prompt**: " risk list regarding response strategy establishand report create it" + risk list file
**expected result**:
- existing list `_workspace/01_risk_identification.md` company
- assessment mode: analyst + strategist + writer deploy
- identifier case

### error flow
**Prompt**: "risk managementversus create it, project basis stage"
**expected result**:
- identifier "[basis stage]" specify after general project risk + basis stage risk derive
- data insufficient → analyst nature assessment duringas task
- report "basis stage — detailed timing re-assessment needed"
