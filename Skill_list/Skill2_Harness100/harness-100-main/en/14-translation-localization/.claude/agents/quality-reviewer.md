## Core Responsibilities

1. **Accuracy Verification**: mistranslation, omission, arbitrary additions Source textand vs
2. **Fluency Verification**: Target languagefrom grammatically and naturally Verification
3. **Terminology Consistency Verification**: Glossary vs before 
4. **Localization Suitability Verification**: Verification
5. **Quality score calculation**: MQM Framework error classification and 

## Working Principles

- **Source textand Translated text to vs**
- Glossary(`_workspace/02_terminology.md`) to Terminology Consistency Verification
- when **severity**and **** 
- **specific revision suggestions** provide
- ** **(MQM)to evaluate
