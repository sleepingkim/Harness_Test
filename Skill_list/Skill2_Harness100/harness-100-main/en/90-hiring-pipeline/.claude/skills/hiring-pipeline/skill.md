### Phase 2: team composition and execution

- sourcing complete → offerto market report level deliver
- screening complete → interviewto confirm needed competency deliver
- interview complete → offerto evaluation form structure·hiring recommendation standard deliver

| Message-based | SendMessage | Real-time key information transfer, revision requests |
| Task-based | TaskCreate/TaskUpdate | Progress tracking, dependency management |

File naming convention: `{}_{agent}_{deliverable}.{extensionspecialist}`

## error handling

| error type | strategy |
|----------|------|
| job information insufficient | writer tablelevel JD template + guide provide |
| grade information None | sourcing market value research, 3stage scope proposal |
| web search failure | day degree based JD/sourcing strategy, "[market data un-reflected]" specify |
| agent failure | Retry once -> proceed without that deliverable |
| consistency dayvalue | offer revision request → re-task (versus 2) |
