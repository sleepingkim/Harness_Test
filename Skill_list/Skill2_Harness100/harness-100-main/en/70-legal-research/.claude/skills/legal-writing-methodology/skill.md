## Risk Response Strategy Framework

### Strategy Options Comparison Table

```markdown
| Option | Litigation | Mediation/Arbitration | Negotiation | Avoidance |
|--------|------------|-----------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Expected Duration | 1–3 years | 3–6 months | 1–3 months | Immediate |
| Expected Cost | High | Medium | Low | None |
| Win Probability | [%] | - | - | - |
| Confidentiality | Not possible | Possible | Possible | - |
| Precedential Effect | Yes | No | No | - |
| Enforceability | Strong | Medium | Weak | - |
| Relationship Impact | Destructive | Neutral | Preserved | Preserved |
```

### Cost-Benefit Analysis

```
Expected Value of Litigation = (Win Probability × Award Amount) - (Litigation Costs + Opportunity Costs + Loss Risk)

Decision Criteria:
  Expected Value > 0: Litigation worth considering
  Expected Value < 0: Prioritize negotiation/mediation
  Expected Value ≈ 0: Consider non-monetary factors (precedent, deterrence effect)
