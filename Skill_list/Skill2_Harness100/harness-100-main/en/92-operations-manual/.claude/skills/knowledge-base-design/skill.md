# Knowledge Base Design

Enhances the knowledge systematization capabilities of faq-builder / manual-writer agents.

## FAQ Design Principles

### FAQ Category Design

```
Step 1: User journey-based classification
  Getting started → Basic usage → Advanced features → Troubleshooting → Administration

Step 2: 5-10 questions per category
  - Sort by frequency (highest first)
  - Write questions in user language

Step 3: Cross-references
  - Link between related FAQs
  - Link to corresponding manual sections
```

### FAQ Writing Template

```markdown
## Q: [Question in the form users actually ask]

**A:** [1-2 sentence key answer]

[Detailed explanation if needed]

**Steps:**
1. [Specific action 1]
2. [Specific action 2]
3. [Specific action 3]

> Reference: [Link to related manual section]
> Related question: [Link to related FAQ]
```

### FAQ Quality Rules

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Question = User language | Everyday expressions, not jargon |
| Answer = 1-line summary + details | Easy to scan |
| 1 FAQ = 1 topic | Split compound questions |
| Screenshots/diagrams | Include visual explanations |
| Updated date | Specify last verified date |

## Troubleshooting Guide Structure

### Symptom-Based Diagnostic Tree

```mermaid

    S([Symptom: X is not working]) --> Q1{Network connection?}
    Q1 -->|Connected| Q2{Logged in?}
    Q1 -->|Not connected| FIX1[Check network → Retry]
    Q2 -->|Logged in| Q3{Has permissions?}
    Q2 -->|Not logged in| FIX2[Re-login]
    Q3 -->|Yes| FIX3[Clear cache → Retry]
    Q3 -->|No| FIX4[Request permissions from admin]
```

### Troubleshooting Card Template

```markdown
## Problem: [Symptom description]

### Impact
- Scope: [All/Partial/Individual]
- Urgency: [Immediate/24 hours/72 hours]

### Possible Causes
| # | Cause | Likelihood | How to Verify |
|---|-------|-----------|---------------|
| 1 | [Most common cause] | High | [Verification command/method] |
| 2 | [Second cause] | Medium | [Verification command/method] |
| 3 | [Rare cause] | Low | [Verification command/method] |

### Resolution Steps
**If Cause 1:**
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. Verify: [Success criteria]

### Escalation
- Not resolved within 30 min → [L2 owner]
- Service outage → [Emergency contact]
